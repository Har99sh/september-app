$ docker images -a   /// see running images


/////INSTRUCTIONS/////////

These instructions for psql part are for macOS, you can try this if it works on windows or linux, if not search google for your corresponding OS.

Download docker or Docker Desktop;

https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

run docker;


<dockerFileUserName>  : adminUser
password : docker


open terminal

inside root folder of project

    $ docker build -t db_just_4_work ./    //build the db in docker

    $ docker run -d --name postgres_container -p 5414:5432 db_just_4_work

    $ docker exec -it postgres_container /bin/sh  //gets you inside docker container from terminal

    $ su

    $ psql -U <dockerFileUserName> db_just_4_work // this will get you inside the database as you would usually through a terminal, but inside docker




To connect to docker database from outside:

in another terminal:

    $ psql -h localhost -p 5414 -U <dockerUserName> db_just_4_work  // this will give you the same db access from outside without being inside docker cli


Configuration inside project 

inside .env file create variable with value

    PGSQL_PORT = 5414
    
    give the username and password variables the same value as the dockerFileUserName

Continue as normal, this should be enough to dump the sql file with the db creation, run docker container and connect the project with database.
